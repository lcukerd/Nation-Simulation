4 players are trained using Genetic Algorithm to simulate nations. Each player represent a country. Players can either do nothing, build army or attack. Each player starts with same amount of land and earn revenue for every unit of land. They can attack each other and win a small portion of land from their opponent upon victory. The player having larger army wins in battle. But, the cost of building an army is very high. Single unit of army costs 2 turns worth of revenue generated by the whole initial assigned land. Player having most money after 50 rounds wins. Player can :
<ul>
<li>Do nothing and keep earning revenue</li>
<li>Build army for defense and stay defensive</li>
<li>Take aggresive approach and build army to attack and earn more land</li>
</ul>

The result was that players took aggresive approach and the best strategist won everytime with around 3555 in bank and others at 1775, 2000 and 0. Even though they all could have earned 2500 by doing nothing.
This was just fun project I thought of doing in my free time.
